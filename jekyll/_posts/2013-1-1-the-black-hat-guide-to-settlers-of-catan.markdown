If Silicon Valley had an official sport, it would be [Settlers of Catan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_of_Catan). I played for the first time within days of moving here, and haven't stopped since. I've heard legends of investors playing with startup founders for convertible notes.

With 50-100 games under my belt, I've seen or used "every scam, con, hustle, hoodwink, gambit, flim-flam, strategem, and bamboozle" out there, spanning from innocent advantages to outright cheating. I don't use any of them anymore, though when I was learning they were a great crutch.

Many of these are OK, even if you get caught. Some of them are pretty terrible and will ruin your reputation as a player.

### Innocent
* Encourage people to build in useless spots, or don't discourage people from building roads to nowhere.
* Pretend to want to trade with people in order to intel on what cards they have. Then use a Knight or Monopoly to steal.
* When others are trying to trade with you, lie to them about what resources you want.
* Threaten to use a Knight to blackmail people into trading with you. You need a development card, but it doesn't have to be a Knight.
* When placing a settlement on a valuable or rare resource, place it in such a way that no other players can realistically build on the resource.
* If one player is about to win, then forge alliances with other players to keep the game alive. Request ridiculous trades to take longest road or block their settlements.
* Convince players that someone else is going to win, even though they are not.


### Unscrupulous but probably OK
* Don't remind people if they forget to pick up cards.
* If you have a monopoly development card: trade out one resource to other players to get the resources you need. Then use your monopoly to get all the cards you traded away back.
* If getting stolen from and you don't have the card your opponent wants, tell them who does. Show your hand. You can also lie, but be prepared to get called on your bluff.
* Promise future trades. Renege.
* Lie to other players about why you need the cards you're trading for.
* Establish poor reputations for players. Nearly everyone who comes into a Settlers game is told not to trade with my friend Jonathan, and as a result his win rate has been far worse.

### Outright cheating
* Cards get worn over time. Keep track of marks.
* When picking up cards, if people aren't paying attention pick up extras.
* When making 4-for-1 trades, put 2 or 3 cards down instead. People won't be able to tell how many cards you've put down.
* Pick up cards when you're not supposed to. If someone asks what you just picked up, act confused and say you thought something else rolled.
* If you have 8 resource cards and are afraid of a 7 rolling, hide one of them up your sleeve. .

I threw out my DVD collection today. I've had these DVDs for 6 or 7 years and used to watch them all the time. Rebel Without a Cause. Ocean's Eleven. Gone.

It didn't make sense to keep them. I already have them on Amazon, which streams to every device I own and takes up no space. It's the same thing I did with my CD collection 10 years ago when I moved to MP3s. And the same thing I did with my MP3s when I moved to Spotify. Books to Kindle. Photos to Dropbox and Facebook. Notebooks to Hackpad.

The cloud generally refers to virtual goods being moved from clients to a central source. Something similar is happening with physical goods, like dwellings and cars.

Young city-dwellers spend a plurality of their money on rent. But typical rent agreements create additional constraints- furniture, maintenance, fixed time obligations. But new marketplaces are allowing society to circumvent that system entirely. 

From 2009 onwards, I've been living in furnished apartments, sublets, or vacation rentals found on AirBnB, VRBO, or Craigslist. I've rarely bought household stuff since it's all been packaged. Never dealt with maintenance. Very short-term contracts. This made moving trivial, and enabled me to live in six different cities. Other hidden but annoying problems have solutions too. For example, [EarthClassMail](http://www.earthclassmail.com) solved the problem created by constant address-switching problem. They've disentangled the permanent mailing address from place of residence.

I'm also going to sell my car soon. I live in San Francisco and work at home, so I only need a car to run errands. But now, Amazon Prime sends me anything in 2 days. If I need stuff faster, I can use Get It Now or Instacart. Local transportation is better thanks to Uber and Sidecar. And Zipcar or Getaround let me get a car if I still need one, without the hassle of maintenance or the DMV.

This is a beautiful thing because instead of thinking about and dealing with stuff, I can spend more time on people, ideas, travel, and work. This [Jobsian](http://cloud.lomography.com/576/386/20/7fa03077c7ef980bcabc3e5456eb5e5b9a476a.jpg) lifestyle doesn't appeal to everyone, but recent technological change is surfacing the nomads among us.

I threw out my DVD collection today. I've had these DVDs for 6 or 7 years and used to watch them all the time. Rebel Without a Cause. Ocean's Eleven. Gone.

It didn't make sense to keep them. I already have them on Amazon, which streams to every device I own and takes up no space. It's the same thing I did with my CD collection 10 years ago when I moved to MP3s. And the same thing I did with my MP3s when I moved to Spotify. Books to Kindle. Photos to Dropbox and Facebook. Notebooks to Hackpad.

But this cloud movement isn't restricted to virtual goods. AirBnB is the cloud for apartments. Getaround is the cloud for cars. And these changes are molding our society towards less ownership.

For example, young city-dwellers spend a plurality of their money on rent. But typical rent agreements create additional constraints- furniture, maintenance, fixed time obligations. But new marketplaces are allowing society to circumvent that system entirely. 

From 2009 onwards, I've been living in furnished apartments, sublets, or vacation rentals found on AirBnB, VRBO, or Craigslist. I've rarely bought household goods or furniture, avoided dealing with maintenance, and signed only short-term contracts. This made moving trivial, and enabled me to live in six different cities in three years. Other relevant problems are solved too- for example, [EarthClassMail](http://www.earthclassmail.com) solved the problem created by constant address-switching. They've disentangled the permanent mailing address from place of residence. My entire dwelling became borrowable and exchangeable, like streaming a song on Spotify. One day, I suspect I'll be able to pay a membership fee and live wherever I want.

I'm also going to sell my car soon. I live in San Francisco and work at home, so I only need a car to run errands. But now, Amazon Prime sends me anything in 2 days. If I need stuff faster, I can use Get It Now or Instacart. Local transportation is better thanks to Uber and Sidecar. And Zipcar or Getaround let me get a car if I still need one, without the hassle of maintenance or the DMV.

Now, every day saved dealing with stuff is another I can spend on people, ideas, travel, and work- the things that count. This [Jobsian](http://cloud.lomography.com/576/386/20/7fa03077c7ef980bcabc3e5456eb5e5b9a476a.jpg) lifestyle doesn't appeal to everyone- we're always going to have hoarders. But recent technological change is surfacing the nomads among us.

> Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer, and then you'll notice you've got their strict attention.


signal vs. noise
- soapbox phenomenon- everyone's yelling the same thing
- how to cut through the noise
  - building relationships
  - understanding the audience

- startup ideas
  - work on spaces that others aren't working on
  - solve hard problems
  - don't have a unique advantage? get one.

- recruiting
  - soapbox phenomenon- everyone's yelling the same thing
  - recruiters hounding people

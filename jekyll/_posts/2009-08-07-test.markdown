Welcome to our blog! In this space we plan to feature gift ideas, talk about trends in gift giving, and explore ways to make gift giving easier for the sender and more enjoyable for the recipient. For example, in the next few days we will be posting about some great Father's Day gift ideas. If you have any ideas or requests for stuff you'd like to see on this blog, feel free to email us at blog@giftrocket.com.

### We're making gift cards better

Gifts should be fun. People shouldn't have to sell or trade gift cards, or worry about spending exactly the right amount. At GiftRocket, we created a gift card we'd actually want to receive, that works for any business. All the recipient does is check in at the location and then gets a PayPal credit for the full gift amount. For more information, check out [how it works](http://www.giftrocket.com/how-it-works).

Thanks for stopping by!s

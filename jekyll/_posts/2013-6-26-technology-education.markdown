A lot of people say that they want to learn how to code. That's been the reason for the success of Codecademy and Treehouse.

But Codecademy, Treehouse, and other online courses aren't always appropriate. People want to learn how to code for many different reasons, and each motivating factor is actually far more revealing about what people should really be doing to accomplish their goal.

I don't have much data, but based on the 10 or so friends who have had the "I want to learn to code" conversation with me, I see three categories:

1. *Coding professionals:* Folks who want to build something themselves or work as a coding professional.
2. *Non-technical technology professionals:* Folks who want to achieve a technical awareness and general understanding of web and mobile technologies.
3. *Dabblers:* Folks who want to feel like they achieved something at the end of the day.

My belief is that the second group is neglected and stuck using options 1 and 3 to try to accomplish their original objective. Let's examine the groups.

### Coding professionals

For the group that want to build something or work as a coding professional, common wisdom in the engineering community is that you learn by doing.

If you're going to build applications, the best way to learn is to build applications. I've seen this echoed amongst the developer community and on [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3007945).\[1\]

For those who need a bit more structure, and want to build websites, I'm really bullish on DevBootcamp and Hacker School. The premise of the programs are simple- students code for 8 hours a day, and when they get stuck they talk to other students or more knowledgeable mentors that are around.

### Non-technical technology professionals

These folks don't want to build. They want to be able to understand what is possible or automatable with code. They want to communicate effectively with technical people and make business decisions related to technology. They're often in PM, marketing, BD, or management roles at technology companies.

Here's are some of the things they want to know:
- How websites work (e.g. what is HTML, CSS, Javascript, what is a client, what is a server, what is a database, how do they all weave together)
- How deployment actually works
- What programming languages do, and the difference between low level and high level
- How programming can solve mathematical problems
- How good code and bad code vary
- What open source is and why people contribute
- An understanding of software development and common pitfalls

Here's what they don't want to know:
- Javascript syntax
- AWS configuration settings
- The documentation for arrays and hashes in their language of choice

The unfortunate thing is that I haven't found a good online resource for this. The data is scattered all over the web and the friction from googling around and inconsistent presentation of information makes this really really annoying. So free startup idea: someone build this and watch the money come in.

Instead, the non-technical tech professionals go to the closest alternative- online coding courses. And they wind up learning Ruby syntax when they really just want to know what it takes to build a new feature on their company's app. It's like teaching assembly language to someone who wants to build websites. The classes teach the wrong layer of abstraction.

As a result, you wind up with guys like Bloomberg who are never going to write a line of production javascript in their life, but are making a public commitment to doing it anyway because they want to be tech literate.

The interactive online courses are good for a few things. They get someone up and running with the basics of programming without having to set up a dev environment. The social aspects of the courses help people keep moving forward through the classes. And they give the dabblers a taste of what real coding professionals do. But they fall short for the second group.


### Notes


\[1\] Learning to code feels a lot like TDD. You want to build a website. So you hear ruby on rails is good way to do that. So you start reading about rails, and then realize you need to have a general understanding of ruby. So you complete a couple ruby tutorials and get relatively comfortable with ruby. Once you've done that, you suddenly realize that you have no understanding of how databases work. So then you read a book about databases. And then you want to make your website look good. So now you have to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Suddenly you've completed a project.

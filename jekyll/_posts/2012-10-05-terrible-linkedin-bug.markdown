title: "LinkedIn Is Providing Incorrect Contact Information"

I have two LinkedIn contacts who have the same name, but are two different people. LinkedIn provides me the same email address in the "contact" sidebar on their profile pages. As a result of this, I sent an email to the wrong person this morning.

I don't know why this is happening. My only guess is that when users upload their address books to find contacts, LinkedIn goes through them and does some guesswork to find the contact and assign it to a connection. But this approach is really strange because that user's primary address (the one they provided when they signed up) is listed in the contact popup when you click the "view/edit contact info" link. But still the fuzzy-matched email is the one displayed in the sidebar.

If you work at LinkedIn, contact me and I will send you screenshots.

I noticed something interesting happening in my Amazon purchase behavior over the last few months. I've been going the route of physical books over Kindle editions, largely because they're so much cheaper.

This is in spite of my personal preference for Kindle versions. I like getting content immediately, and I like [not having stuff](http://www.kapilkale.com/blog/the-housing-cloud/). But it's just so much cheaper to buy a used print edition and have it shipped (usually via Amazon Prime).

Here are some comparisons on the last 3 books I purchased.

* [The Well Grounded Rubyist](http://www.amazon.com/Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1933988657). [$36 digital copy](http://www.manning.com/black2/). ~$8 used shipped Amazon Prime.
* [The Modern Firm](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0198293763). $92 for the new Hardcover, $16 for the Kindle edition, and $6 shipped used.
* [Hard Landing](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0812928350). $18 for the Kindle edition, $6 shipped used.

My decision to buy is obvious and uninteresting, but apply my mentality to the crowds and you'll uncover a lot of strange implications for the publishing industry.

* Amazon shipping used books Prime means no one should buy new editions unless they're available. I don't think people care much about the quality of their books.
* There's a huge price inversion.

As an engineer or designer, working at a startup is not a risk.

**Financial risk:** Most well-funded startups (series-A +) match big company salaries for engineers. Unless the engineer wants a substantial amount of equity, in which case they might take a modest pay cut (20%). I think the perception is skewed by early stage startups that give out lowball offers, but most startup jobs aren't at companies of that stage.

**Reputational risk:** My good friend Pooneet worked at GiftRocket the summer before starting business school. It was a miserable time to be at GiftRocket- we were in the trough of sorrows and struggling. It wasn't until he left that we started getting traction. But the experience for him was invaluable- it ended up being the thing he spoke about the most when he interviewed for finance jobs. PE fund managers were asking him about this 3 month stint at a struggling startup. Failed startups are even better.

**Job security risk:** Let's define job security as the likelihood of being able to work at X company in Y years. Then yes, startups are certainly riskier than big companies. But job security shouldn't matter for engineers. If a startup fails, other startups in the ecosystem are going to vulture up its engineers. Acq-hires are an extreme version of this. [You can work at a big company, leave to start a startup, and get acqhired back into your own job.](http://www.google.com)\[1\]

This wasn't always true. But the ecosystem has gotten better- I think almost as good as a big stable public company. 



\[1\] I'm pretty sure there are extenuating circumstances with this stuff too. I worked with someone who had a medical condition and needed to constantly have insurance from her employer. So the risk of having a small period of unemployment was very high.

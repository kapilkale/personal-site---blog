        <div class="post_content">
          <p>I threw out my DVD collection today. I&#8217;ve had these DVDs for 6 or 7 years and used to watch them all the time. Rebel Without a Cause. Ocean&#8217;s Eleven. Gone.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t make sense to keep them. I already have them on Amazon, which streams to every device I own and takes up no space. It&#8217;s the same thing I did with my CD collection 10 years ago when I moved to MP3s. And the same thing I did with my MP3s when I moved to Spotify. Books to Kindle. Photos to Dropbox and Facebook. Notebooks to Hackpad.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s cloud movement isn&#8217;t restricted to virtual goods. Zipcar is the cloud for cars. Exec is the cloud for secretarial work. And though there isn&#8217;t a &#8220;cloud&#8221; for housing, AirBnB, Craigslist, and VRBO are getting close.</p>

<p>I am convinced that as the system gets better, one day <strong>I&#8217;ll be able to pay a membership fee and live wherever I want.</strong></p>

<p>From 2009 onwards, I&#8217;ve been living in furnished apartments, sublets, vacation rentals, or hotels. The benefits have been amazing. I rarely bought household goods or furniture, avoided dealing with maintenance or repair, and signed only short-term contracts. <a href='http://www.earthclassmail.com'>EarthClassMail</a> disentangled my permanent mailing address from where I was currently living. The resulting mobility enabled me to live in six different cities in three years. My housing situation felt like borrowing movies on Netflix or spinning up instances on AWS.</p>

<p>For some it works really well. <a href='http://www.http://www.amazon.com/The-Upgrade-Cautionary-Reservations-ebook/dp/B005CI2IUA'>Paul Carr did it</a> with hotels. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XOf-GUMCXk'>Sam Lessin</a> was less positive on his experience despite being huge on renting vs buying. For me, it always felt like a bit of a hack. I was constantly surfing Craigslist, AirBnB, Starwood, etc. looking for my next spot. Assuming more people like me crop up over the coming years, a true cloud housing provider will come into existence.</p>

<p>Every day saved dealing with stuff is another I can spend on people, ideas, travel, and work- the things that count. Housing is no exception. This <a href='http://cloud.lomography.com/576/386/20/7fa03077c7ef980bcabc3e5456eb5e5b9a476a.jpg'>Jobs-esque</a> lifestyle doesn&#8217;t appeal to everyone- we&#8217;re always going to have hoarders. But as Sam Lessin predicts, ownership will be a curse of the underprivileged in the future. Recent technological change is surfacing the nomads among us.</p>

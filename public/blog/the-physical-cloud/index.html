        <div class="post_content">
          <p>I threw out my DVD collection today. I&#8217;ve had these DVDs for 6 or 7 years and used to watch them all the time. Rebel Without a Cause. Ocean&#8217;s Eleven. Gone.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t make sense to keep them. I already have them on Amazon, which streams to every device I own and takes up no space. It&#8217;s the same thing I did with my CD collection 10 years ago when I moved to MP3s. And the same thing I did with my MP3s when I moved to Spotify. Books to Kindle. Photos to Dropbox and Facebook. Notebooks to Hackpad.</p>

<p>The cloud generally refers to virtual goods being moved from clients to a central source. Something similar is happening with physical goods, like dwellings and cars.</p>

<p>Young city-dwellers spend a plurality of their money on rent. But typical rent agreements create additional constraints- furniture, maintenance, fixed time obligations. But new marketplaces are allowing society to circumvent that system entirely.</p>

<p>From 2009 onwards, I&#8217;ve been living in furnished apartments, sublets, or vacation rentals found on AirBnB, VRBO, or Craigslist. I&#8217;ve rarely bought household stuff since it&#8217;s all been packaged. Never dealt with maintenance. Very short-term contracts. This made moving trivial, and enabled me to live in six different cities. Other hidden but annoying problems have solutions too. For example, <a href='http://www.earthclassmail.com'>EarthClassMail</a> solved the problem created by constant address-switching problem. They&#8217;ve disentangled the permanent mailing address from place of residence.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also going to sell my car soon. I live in San Francisco and work at home, so I only need a car to run errands. But now, Amazon Prime sends me anything in 2 days. If I need stuff faster, I can use Get It Now or Instacart. Local transportation is better thanks to Uber and Sidecar. And Zipcar or Getaround let me get a car if I still need one, without the hassle of maintenance or the DMV.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful thing because instead of thinking about and dealing with stuff, I can spend more time on people, ideas, travel, and work. This <a href='http://cloud.lomography.com/576/386/20/7fa03077c7ef980bcabc3e5456eb5e5b9a476a.jpg'>Jobsian</a> lifestyle doesn&#8217;t appeal to everyone, but recent technological change is surfacing the nomads among us.</p>

        <div class="post_content">
          <p>If Silicon Valley had an official sport, it would be <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_of_Catan'>Settlers of Catan</a>. I played for the first time within days of moving here, and haven&#8217;t stopped since. I&#8217;ve heard legends of investors playing with startup founders for convertible notes.</p>

<p>With 50-100 games under my belt, I&#8217;ve seen or used &#8220;every scam, con, hustle, hoodwink, gambit, flim-flam, strategem, and bamboozle&#8221; out there, spanning from innocent advantages to outright cheating. I don&#8217;t use any of them anymore, though when I was learning they were a great crutch.</p>

<p>Many of these are OK, even if you get caught. Some of them are pretty terrible and will ruin your reputation as a player.</p>

<h3 id='innocent'>Innocent</h3>

<ul>
<li>Encourage people to build in useless spots, or don&#8217;t discourage people from building roads to nowhere.</li>

<li>Pretend to want to trade with people in order to intel on what cards they have. Then use a Knight or Monopoly to steal.</li>

<li>When others are trying to trade with you, lie to them about what resources you want.</li>

<li>Threaten to use a Knight to blackmail people into trading with you. You need a development card, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be a Knight.</li>

<li>When placing a settlement on a valuable or rare resource, place it in such a way that no other players can realistically build on the resource.</li>

<li>If one player is about to win, then forge alliances with other players to keep the game alive. Request ridiculous trades to take longest road or block their settlements.</li>

<li>Convince players that someone else is going to win, even though they are not.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='unscrupulous_but_probably_ok'>Unscrupulous but probably OK</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t remind people if they forget to pick up cards.</li>

<li>If you have a monopoly development card: trade out one resource to other players to get the resources you need. Then use your monopoly to get all the cards you traded away back.</li>

<li>If getting stolen from and you don&#8217;t have the card your opponent wants, tell them who does. Show your hand. You can also lie, but be prepared to get called on your bluff.</li>

<li>Promise future trades. Renege.</li>

<li>Lie to other players about why you need the cards you&#8217;re trading for.</li>

<li>Establish poor reputations for players. Nearly everyone who comes into a Settlers game is told not to trade with my friend Jonathan, and as a result his win rate has been far worse.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='outright_cheating'>Outright cheating</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cards get worn over time. Keep track of marks.</li>

<li>When picking up cards, if people aren&#8217;t paying attention pick up extras.</li>

<li>When making 4-for-1 trades, put 2 or 3 cards down instead. People won&#8217;t be able to tell how many cards you&#8217;ve put down.</li>

<li>Pick up cards when you&#8217;re not supposed to. If someone asks what you just picked up, act confused and say you thought something else rolled.</li>

<li>If you have 8 resource cards and are afraid of a 7 rolling, hide one of them up your sleeve. .</li>
</ul>

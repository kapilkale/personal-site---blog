  <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/blog/paper-books-cheaper-than-kindle/">Used Paper Books are Cheaper Than Kindle</a></h2>
  <p class="post_subheader">1/2/2013 by Kapil</p>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p>I noticed something interesting happening in my Amazon purchase behavior over the last few months. I&#8217;ve been going the route of physical books over Kindle editions, largely because they&#8217;re so much cheaper.</p>

<p>This is in spite of my personal preference for Kindle versions. I like getting content immediately, and I like <a href='http://www.kapilkale.com/blog/the-housing-cloud/'>not having stuff</a>. But it&#8217;s just so much cheaper to buy a used print edition and have it shipped (usually via Amazon Prime).</p>

<p>Here are some comparisons on the last 3 books I purchased.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1933988657'>The Well Grounded Rubyist</a>. <a href='http://www.manning.com/black2/'>$36 digital copy</a>. ~$8 used shipped Amazon Prime.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0198293763'>The Modern Firm</a>. $92 for the new Hardcover, $16 for the Kindle edition, and $6 shipped used.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/0812928350'>Hard Landing</a>. $18 for the Kindle edition, $6 shipped used.</li>
</ul>

<p>My decision to buy is obvious and uninteresting, but apply my mentality to the crowds and you&#8217;ll uncover a lot of strange implications for the publishing industry.</p>

<ul>
<li>Amazon shipping used books Prime means no one should buy new editions unless they&#8217;re available. I don&#8217;t think people care much about the quality of their books.</li>

<li>There&#8217;s a huge price inversion.</li>
</ul>

  <p class="post_subheader">1/2/2013 by Kapil</p>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p>If Silicon Valley had an official sport, it would be <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_of_Catan'>Settlers of Catan</a>. I played for the first time within days of moving here, and haven&#8217;t stopped since. I&#8217;ve heard legends of investors playing with startup founders for convertible notes.</p>

<p>With 50-100 games under my belt, I&#8217;ve seen or used &#8220;every scam, con, hustle, hoodwink, gambit, flim-flam, strategem, and bamboozle&#8221; out there, spanning from innocent advantages to outright cheating. I don&#8217;t use any of them anymore, though when I was learning they were a great crutch.</p>

<p>Many of these are OK, even if you get caught. Some of them are pretty terrible and will ruin your reputation as a player.</p>

<h3 id='innocent'>Innocent</h3>

<ul>
<li>Encourage people to build in useless spots, or don&#8217;t discourage people from building roads to nowhere.</li>

<li>Pretend to want to trade with people in order to intel on what cards they have. Then use a Knight or Monopoly to steal.</li>

<li>When others are trying to trade with you, lie to them about what resources you want.</li>

<li>Threaten to use a Knight to blackmail people into trading with you. You need a development card, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be a Knight.</li>

<li>When placing a settlement on a valuable or rare resource, place it in such a way that no other players can realistically build on the resource.</li>

<li>If one player is about to win, then forge alliances with other players to keep the game alive. Request ridiculous trades to take longest road or block their settlements.</li>

<li>Convince players that someone else is going to win, even though they are not.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='unscrupulous_but_probably_ok'>Unscrupulous but probably OK</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t remind people if they forget to pick up cards.</li>

<li>If you have a monopoly development card: trade out one resource to other players to get the resources you need. Then use your monopoly to get all the cards you traded away back.</li>

<li>If getting stolen from and you don&#8217;t have the card your opponent wants, tell them who does. Show your hand. You can also lie, but be prepared to get called on your bluff.</li>

<li>Promise future trades. Renege.</li>

<li>Lie to other players about why you need the cards you&#8217;re trading for.</li>

<li>Establish poor reputations for players. Nearly everyone who comes into a Settlers game is told not to trade with my friend Jonathan, and as a result his win rate has been far worse.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='outright_cheating'>Outright cheating</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cards get worn over time. Keep track of marks.</li>

<li>When picking up cards, if people aren&#8217;t paying attention pick up extras.</li>

<li>When making 4-for-1 trades, put 2 or 3 cards down instead. People won&#8217;t be able to tell how many cards you&#8217;ve put down.</li>

<li>Pick up cards when you&#8217;re not supposed to. If someone asks what you just picked up, act confused and say you thought something else rolled.</li>

<li>If you have 8 resource cards and are afraid of a 7 rolling, hide one of them up your sleeve. .</li>

  <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/blog/the-worst-ui-pattern-in-existence/">The Worst UI Pattern in Existence</a></h2>
  <p class="post_subheader">12/14/2012 by Kapil</p>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p>Infinite scroll + footer. Scroll through page content to the footer. As you start reading the footer links, the site injects new content into the page and the footer gets pushed down below the fold. Repeat ad nauseum.</p>

<p>Facebook and LinkedIn&#8217;s news feeds use this pattern. I get that most Facebook &amp; Linkedin users don&#8217;t need to touch the footer, but this doesn&#8217;t excuse a terrible UI for those that do. Especially when better design options are available.</p>

<p>Their design teams are aware of the issue, but their &#8220;fixes&#8221; aren&#8217;t very good.</p>

<p>LinkedIn&#8217;s solution is to end the infinite scroll after three reloads. But as a result, a user has to deal with 3 terrible UI events before they get what they want. Will they overcome the <a href='http://www.daviesscoll.u-net.com/joc/students/assignments/asassignments/classical.htm'>conditioning</a> or just give up?</p>
<img src='/linkedin_footer.jpg' width='400px' />
<p>Facebook&#8217;s solution is smarter- they put footer links in the right sidebar, which is excluded from the infinte scroll. But there&#8217;s a second footer- the normal footer- at the bottom of the page where expected:</p>
<img src='/footer.jpg' width='400px' />
<p>There are two problems with this design.</p>

<p>First: the brief glimpse of the first footer distracts from the existence of the nontraditionally-placed second footer; I&#8217;d bet most users don&#8217;t even see footer #2.</p>

<p>Second: footer #2 doesn&#8217;t have the full set of links. For example, you&#8217;d miss the &#8220;developers&#8221; link because it&#8217;s buried under &#8220;more&#8221;. Which makes a user want to chase footer #1 all the more.</p>

<p>As a UI guy at <a href='http://www.giftrocket.com/gift-cards/restaurants'>GiftRocket</a>, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d do: get rid of the normal footer, and list a full set of links in footer #2. When people scroll down looking for footer links, they&#8217;ll won&#8217;t see a footer in the normal place, but instead see the floating footer on the right.</p>

  <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/blog/the-housing-cloud/">The Housing Cloud</a></h2>
  <p class="post_subheader">11/30/2012 by Kapil</p>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p>I threw out my DVD collection today. Rebel Without a Cause. Ocean&#8217;s Eleven. Gone. I own most of them on Amazon Instant Video, so I didn&#8217;t need them anymore.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the same thing I did with my CD collection 10 years ago when I moved to MP3s, or with my MP3 collection when I moved to Spotify. Books to Kindle. Photos to Dropbox and Facebook. Notebooks to Hackpad. Nearly all of my digitizable content is in the cloud.</p>

<p>Physical things are moving to the cloud too. Zipcar is the cloud for cars. Exec is the cloud for secretarial work. And though there isn&#8217;t a &#8220;cloud&#8221; for housing, AirBnB, Craigslist, and VRBO are getting close.</p>

<p>From 2009 onwards, I&#8217;ve been living in furnished apartments, sublets, vacation rentals, or <a href='http://www.giftrocket.com/gift-cards/hotels'>hotels</a>. The benefits have been amazing. I rarely bought household goods or furniture, avoided dealing with maintenance or repair, and signed only short-term contracts. Earth Class Mail disentangled my permanent mailing address from where I was currently living. The resulting mobility enabled me to live in six different cities in three years. My housing situation felt like borrowing movies on Netflix or spinning up instances on AWS.</p>

<p>Working for <a href='http://www.giftrocket.com/'>GiftRocket</a> has given me flexibility in where I can work.</p>

<p>For some it works really well. <a href='http://www.amazon.com/The-Upgrade-Cautionary-Reservations-ebook/dp/B005CI2IUA'>Paul Carr did it</a> with hotels. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XOf-GUMCXk'>Sam Lessin</a> was less positive on his experience. For me, it always felt like a bit of a hack. I spent more time surfing Craigslist, AirBnB, Starwood than I would have liked[1]. The transaction costs were non-trivial.</p>

<p>The nature of the problem is uncertain timing. With fixed long-term stays everyone is comfortable signing leases and furnishing apartments. But I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m going to be traveling to another city until a couple weeks before. And the periods of stay might be minimal. As a result, I&#8217;ll be paying for two housing units- my apartment in one location and a hotel in another.</p>

<p>The uncertain timing makes renting out my apartment a pain. I have to worry about posting a listing, managing inquiries, interacting with guests, and having the apartment cleaned. All potentially while I&#8217;m out of town. These transaction costs result in an inefficient market.</p>

<p>However, these transaction costs will go down over time. Airbnb helps market the listings. Property managers help with interactions and cleanings, but at the moment they&#8217;re expensive and only available for true vacation properties. Once these inconveniences go away, housing will truly be a cloud-like entity.</p>

<p>And at that point, I suspect far more people will attempt to live in the housing cloud- moving from place to place at will. Not thinking about &#8220;stuff&#8221;, and spending their time on more valuable things like people, ideas, travel, and work. This lifestyle doesn&#8217;t appeal to everyone, but these changes will certainly surface the nomads among us.</p>
<hr />
<p>[1] There was actually a period of 2 months where I had no stable housing at all. I was on business travel 3 days a week, using the points I was accumulating to stay in cheap hotels another 2 days a week, and then crashing with friends for the last 2. It led to some strange situations, like having to change clothes in my car, or forgetting dry cleaning in another city.</p>

  <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/blog/terrible-linkedin-bug/">LinkedIn Is Providing Incorrect Contact Information</a></h2>
  <p class="post_subheader">10/5/2012 by Kapil</p>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p>I have two LinkedIn contacts who have the same name, but are two different people. LinkedIn provides me the same email address in the &#8220;contact&#8221; sidebar on their profile pages. As a result of this, I sent an email to the wrong person this morning.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why this is happening. My only guess is that when users upload their address books to find contacts, LinkedIn goes through them and does some guesswork to find the contact and assign it to a connection. But this approach is really strange because that user&#8217;s primary address (the one they provided when they signed up) is listed in the contact popup when you click the &#8220;view/edit contact info&#8221; link. Why not just look for proper matches instead of guessing by name?</p>

<p>And though the contacts preferred email is listed, the incorrectly fuzzy-matched email address is the one displayed in the sidebar.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve emailed customer services, but if you work at LinkedIn, contact me and I will send you screenshots.</p>

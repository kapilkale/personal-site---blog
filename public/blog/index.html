  <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/blog/technology-education/">The Two Types of Tech Education</a></h2>
  <p class="post_subheader">6/26/2013 by Kapil</p>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p>A lot of people say that they want to learn how to code. That&#8217;s been the reason for the success of Codecademy and Treehouse.</p>

<p>But Codecademy, Treehouse, and other online courses aren&#8217;t always appropriate. People want to learn how to code for many different reasons, and each motivating factor is actually far more revealing about what people should really be doing to accomplish their goal.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have much data, but based on the 10 or so friends who have had the &#8220;I want to learn to code&#8221; conversation with me, I see three categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Coding professionals:</em> Folks who want to build something themselves or work as a coding professional.</li>

<li><em>Non-technical technology professionals:</em> Folks who want to achieve a technical awareness and general understanding of web and mobile technologies.</li>

<li><em>Dabblers:</em> Folks who want to feel like they achieved something at the end of the day.</li>
</ol>

<p>My belief is that the second group is neglected and stuck using options 1 and 3 to try to accomplish their original objective. Let&#8217;s examine the groups.</p>

<h3 id='coding_professionals'>Coding professionals</h3>

<p>For the group that want to build something or work as a coding professional, common wisdom in the engineering community is that you learn by doing.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re going to build applications, the best way to learn is to build applications. I&#8217;ve seen this echoed amongst the developer community and on <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3007945'>hacker news</a>.[1]</p>

<p>For those who need a bit more structure, and want to build websites, I&#8217;m really bullish on DevBootcamp and Hacker School. The premise of the programs are simple- students code for 8 hours a day, and when they get stuck they talk to other students or more knowledgeable mentors that are around.</p>

<h3 id='nontechnical_technology_professionals'>Non-technical technology professionals</h3>

<p>These folks don&#8217;t want to build. They want to be able to understand what is possible or automatable with code. They want to communicate effectively with technical people and make business decisions related to technology. They&#8217;re often in PM, marketing, BD, or management roles at technology companies.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s are some of the things they want to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>How websites work (e.g. what is HTML, CSS, Javascript, what is a client, what is a server, what is a database, how do they all weave together)</li>

<li>How deployment actually works</li>

<li>What programming languages do, and the difference between low level and high level</li>

<li>How programming can solve mathematical problems</li>

<li>How good code and bad code vary</li>

<li>What open source is and why people contribute</li>

<li>An understanding of software development and common pitfalls</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#8217;s what they don&#8217;t want to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Javascript syntax</li>

<li>AWS configuration settings</li>

<li>The documentation for arrays and hashes in their language of choice</li>
</ul>

<p>The unfortunate thing is that I haven&#8217;t found a good online resource for this. The data is scattered all over the web and the friction from googling around and inconsistent presentation of information makes this really really annoying. So free startup idea: someone build this and watch the money come in.</p>

<p>Instead, the non-technical tech professionals go to the closest alternative- online coding courses. And they wind up learning Ruby syntax when they really just want to know what it takes to build a new feature on their company&#8217;s app. It&#8217;s like teaching assembly language to someone who wants to build websites. The classes teach the wrong layer of abstraction. [2]</p>
<img src='/bloomberg.png' width='400px' />
<p>As a result, you wind up with guys like Bloomberg who are never going to write a line of production javascript in their life, but are making a public commitment to doing it anyway because they want to be tech literate.</p>

<p>The interactive online courses are good for a few things. They get someone up and running with the basics of programming without having to set up a dev environment. The social aspects of the courses help people keep moving forward through the classes. And they give the dabblers a taste of what real coding professionals do. But they fall short for the second group.</p>

<h3 id='notes'>Notes</h3>

<p>[1] Learning to code feels a lot like TDD. You want to build a website. So you hear ruby on rails is good way to do that. So you start reading about rails, and then realize you need to have a general understanding of ruby. So you complete a couple ruby tutorials and get relatively comfortable with ruby. Once you&#8217;ve done that, you suddenly realize that you have no understanding of how databases work. So then you read a book about databases. And then you want to make your website look good. So now you have to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Suddenly you&#8217;ve completed a project.</p>

<p>[2] Is it even possible to teach someone who doesn&#8217;t know how to code about these things? I think so. It requires a strong theoretical curriculum, kind of like the one granted to a finance or macroeconomics student who hasn&#8217;t worked in banking or at the fed.</p>

  <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/blog/gmails-second-major-problem/">Gmail's Second Major Problem</a></h2>
  <p class="post_subheader">1/24/2013 by Kapil</p>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p>Gmail&#8217;s first problem is UX speed, and it&#8217;s been well documented by others. [a]</p>

<p>The second is a <strong>sporadic but massive delivery lag</strong>. Where emails arrive in my inbox hours after they were sent.</p>

<p>This is a problem with Google&#8217;s mail servers. Here&#8217;s an example of an email with a 2 hour delivery lag (headers parsed by Google&#8217;s <a href='https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/'>header analyzer</a>):</p>
<a href='/gmail_lag_full.jpg'><img src='/gmail_lag_small.jpg' /></a>
<p>This particular email was so important that I had to get on the phone with the sender. He forwarded 4 additional copies (!) that also had 2 hour delays on them.</p>

<p>This issue has happened 2-3 times in the past month. When it happens, it affects 20-30% of the emails coming into my inbox. Attachments seem to have no impact. The sender has no impact either- it happens with people I email 20 times a day within the same Google Apps account. [b]</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure about prevalence; in fact, one of my motivations in writing this is to see how many other people this is happening to. Google has seen and solved <a href='http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/04/03/google-says-an-issue-with-gmail-is-delaying-under-3-of-messages-with-attachments/'>problems like this before</a>, but mine seems to be different. Their own support page <a href='http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=82458'>gives no reason</a>.</p>

<p>Please fix it Google. And if you can&#8217;t, do two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a Gmail uptime notifier. Like <a href='http://status.heroku.com'>Heroku</a> or <a href='https://status.stripe.com'>Stripe</a>. If I don&#8217;t get something I&#8217;m expecting, it&#8217;d be nice to know that one of the mail servers is backed up or undergoing maintenance. EDIT: <a href='http://www.google.com/appsstatus'>it exists</a></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Take my money. I&#8217;d pay $50 / month to get reliable service; others would be willing to pay <a href='http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html'>orders of magnitude more</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>[a] My friend Jack from <a href='http://www.seatgeek.com/super-bowl-tickets'>SeatGeek</a> did an outstanding job <a href='http://jackg.org/gmail-as-a-facade'>identifying the cause</a>. Paul Graham has explained it best when he said <a href='http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html'>&#8220;If you made something no better than GMail, but fast, that alone would let you start to pull users away from GMail.&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>[b] At <a href='http://www.giftrocket.com'>GiftRocket</a> we do team discussions over email. Getting emails out of order results in utter confusion about the proceedings. Threads that were archived get brought back into my inbox because an email from 6 hours before finally arrives.</p>

  <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/blog/the-worst-ui-pattern-in-existence/">The Worst UI Pattern in Existence</a></h2>
  <p class="post_subheader">12/14/2012 by Kapil</p>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p>Infinite scroll + footer. Scroll through page content to the footer. As you start reading the footer links, the site injects new content into the page and the footer gets pushed down below the fold. Repeat ad nauseum.</p>

<p>Facebook and LinkedIn&#8217;s news feeds use this pattern. I get that most Facebook &amp; Linkedin users don&#8217;t need to touch the footer, but this doesn&#8217;t excuse a terrible UI for those that do. Especially when better design options are available.</p>

<p>Their design teams are aware of the issue, but their &#8220;fixes&#8221; aren&#8217;t very good.</p>

<p>LinkedIn&#8217;s solution is to end the infinite scroll after three reloads. But as a result, a user has to deal with 3 terrible UI events before they get what they want. Will they overcome the <a href='http://www.daviesscoll.u-net.com/joc/students/assignments/asassignments/classical.htm'>conditioning</a> or just give up?</p>
<img src='/linkedin_footer.jpg' width='400px' />
<p>Facebook&#8217;s solution is smarter- they put footer links in the right sidebar, which is excluded from the infinte scroll. But there&#8217;s a second footer- the normal footer- at the bottom of the page where expected:</p>
<img src='/footer.jpg' width='400px' />
<p>There are two problems with this design.</p>

<p>First: the brief glimpse of the first footer distracts from the existence of the nontraditionally-placed second footer; I&#8217;d bet most users don&#8217;t even see footer #2.</p>

<p>Second: footer #2 doesn&#8217;t have the full set of links. For example, you&#8217;d miss the &#8220;developers&#8221; link because it&#8217;s buried under &#8220;more&#8221;. Which makes a user want to chase footer #1 all the more.</p>

<p>As a UI guy at <a href='http://www.giftrocket.com/gift-cards/restaurants'>GiftRocket</a>, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d do: get rid of the normal footer, and list a full set of links in footer #2. When people scroll down looking for footer links, they&#8217;ll won&#8217;t see a footer in the normal place, but instead see the floating footer on the right.</p>

  <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/blog/the-housing-cloud/">The Housing Cloud</a></h2>
  <p class="post_subheader">11/30/2012 by Kapil</p>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p>I threw out my DVD collection today. Rebel Without a Cause. Ocean&#8217;s Eleven. Gone. I own most of them on Amazon Instant Video, so I didn&#8217;t need them anymore.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the same thing I did with my CD collection 10 years ago when I moved to MP3s, or with my MP3 collection when I moved to Spotify. Books to Kindle. Photos to Dropbox and Facebook. Notebooks to Hackpad. Nearly all of my digitizable content is in the cloud.</p>

<p>Physical things are moving to the cloud too. Zipcar is the cloud for cars. Exec is the cloud for secretarial work. And though there isn&#8217;t a &#8220;cloud&#8221; for housing, AirBnB, Craigslist, and VRBO are getting close.</p>

<p>From 2009 onwards, I&#8217;ve been living in furnished apartments, sublets, vacation rentals, or <a href='http://www.giftrocket.com/gift-cards/hotels'>hotels</a>. The benefits have been amazing. I rarely bought household goods or furniture, avoided dealing with maintenance or repair, and signed only short-term contracts. Earth Class Mail disentangled my permanent mailing address from where I was currently living. The resulting mobility enabled me to live in six different cities in three years. My housing situation felt like borrowing movies on Netflix or spinning up instances on AWS.</p>

<p>Working for <a href='http://www.giftrocket.com/'>GiftRocket</a> has given me flexibility in where I can work.</p>

<p>For some it works really well. <a href='http://www.amazon.com/The-Upgrade-Cautionary-Reservations-ebook/dp/B005CI2IUA'>Paul Carr did it</a> with hotels. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XOf-GUMCXk'>Sam Lessin</a> was less positive on his experience. For me, it always felt like a bit of a hack. I spent more time surfing Craigslist, AirBnB, Starwood than I would have liked[1]. The transaction costs were non-trivial.</p>

<p>The nature of the problem is uncertain timing. With fixed long-term stays everyone is comfortable signing leases and furnishing apartments. But I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m going to be traveling to another city until a couple weeks before. And the periods of stay might be minimal. As a result, I&#8217;ll be paying for two housing units- my apartment in one location and a hotel in another.</p>

<p>The uncertain timing makes renting out my apartment a pain. I have to worry about posting a listing, managing inquiries, interacting with guests, and having the apartment cleaned. All potentially while I&#8217;m out of town. These transaction costs result in an inefficient market.</p>

<p>However, these transaction costs will go down over time. Airbnb helps market the listings. Property managers help with interactions and cleanings, but at the moment they&#8217;re expensive and only available for true vacation properties. Once these inconveniences go away, housing will truly be a cloud-like entity.</p>

<p>And at that point, I suspect far more people will attempt to live in the housing cloud- moving from place to place at will. Not thinking about &#8220;stuff&#8221;, and spending their time on more valuable things like people, ideas, travel, and work. This lifestyle doesn&#8217;t appeal to everyone, but these changes will certainly surface the nomads among us.</p>
<hr />
<p>[1] There was actually a period of 2 months where I had no stable housing at all. I was on business travel 3 days a week, using the points I was accumulating to stay in cheap hotels another 2 days a week, and then crashing with friends for the last 2. It led to some strange situations, like having to change clothes in my car, or forgetting dry cleaning in another city.</p>

  <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/blog/terrible-linkedin-bug/">LinkedIn Is Providing Incorrect Contact Information</a></h2>
  <p class="post_subheader">10/5/2012 by Kapil</p>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p>I have two LinkedIn contacts who have the same name, but are two different people. LinkedIn provides me the same email address in the &#8220;contact&#8221; sidebar on their profile pages. As a result of this, I sent an email to the wrong person this morning.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why this is happening. My only guess is that when users upload their address books to find contacts, LinkedIn goes through them and does some guesswork to find the contact and assign it to a connection. But this approach is really strange because that user&#8217;s primary address (the one they provided when they signed up) is listed in the contact popup when you click the &#8220;view/edit contact info&#8221; link. Why not just look for proper matches instead of guessing by name?</p>

<p>And though the contacts preferred email is listed, the incorrectly fuzzy-matched email address is the one displayed in the sidebar.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve emailed customer services, but if you work at LinkedIn, contact me and I will send you screenshots.</p>

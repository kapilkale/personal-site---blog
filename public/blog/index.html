    <p>I threw out my DVD collection today. I&#8217;ve had these DVDs for 6 or 7 years and used to watch them all the time. Rebel Without a Cause. Ocean&#8217;s Eleven. Gone.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t make sense to keep them. I already have them on Amazon, which streams to every device I own and takes up no space. It&#8217;s the same thing I did with my CD collection 10 years ago when I moved to MP3s. And the same thing I did with my MP3s when I moved to Spotify. Books to Kindle. Photos to Dropbox and Facebook. Notebooks to Hackpad.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s cloud movement isn&#8217;t restricted to virtual goods. Zipcar is the cloud for cars. Exec is the cloud for secretarial work. And though there isn&#8217;t a &#8220;cloud&#8221; for housing, AirBnB, Craigslist, and VRBO are getting close.[1]</p>

<p>I am convinced that as the system gets better, one day <strong>I&#8217;ll be able to pay a membership fee and live wherever I want.</strong></p>

<p>From 2009 onwards, I&#8217;ve been living in furnished apartments, sublets, vacation rentals, or hotels. The benefits have been amazing. I rarely bought household goods or furniture, avoided dealing with maintenance or repair, and signed only short-term contracts. <a href='http://www.earthclassmail.com'>EarthClassMail</a> disentangled my permanent mailing address from where I was currently living. The resulting mobility enabled me to live in six different cities in three years. My housing situation felt like borrowing movies on Netflix or spinning up instances on AWS.</p>

<p>For some it works really well. <a href='http://www.http://www.amazon.com/The-Upgrade-Cautionary-Reservations-ebook/dp/B005CI2IUA'>Paul Carr did it</a> with hotels. <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XOf-GUMCXk'>Sam Lessin</a> was less positive on his experience despite being huge on renting vs buying. For me, it always felt like a bit of a hack. I was constantly surfing Craigslist, AirBnB, Starwood, etc. looking for my next spot. Assuming more people like me crop up over the coming years, a true cloud housing provider will come into existence.</p>

<p>Every day saved dealing with stuff is another I can spend on people, ideas, travel, and work- the things that count. Housing is no exception. This <a href='http://cloud.lomography.com/576/386/20/7fa03077c7ef980bcabc3e5456eb5e5b9a476a.jpg'>Jobs-esque</a> lifestyle doesn&#8217;t appeal to everyone- we&#8217;re always going to have hoarders. But as Sam Lessin predicts, ownership will be a curse of the underprivileged in the future. Recent technological change is surfacing the nomads among us.</p>

  <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/blog/terrible-linkedin-bug/">LinkedIn Is Providing Incorrect Contact Information</a></h2>
  <p class="post_subheader">10/5/2012 by Kapil</p>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p>I have two LinkedIn contacts who have the same name, but are two different people. LinkedIn provides me the same email address in the &#8220;contact&#8221; sidebar on their profile pages. As a result of this, I sent an email to the wrong person this morning.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why this is happening. My only guess is that when users upload their address books to find contacts, LinkedIn goes through them and does some guesswork to find the contact and assign it to a connection. But this approach is really strange because that user&#8217;s primary address (the one they provided when they signed up) is listed in the contact popup when you click the &#8220;view/edit contact info&#8221; link. Why not just look for proper matches instead of guessing by name?</p>

<p>And though the contacts preferred email is listed, the incorrectly fuzzy-matched email address is the one displayed in the sidebar.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve emailed customer services, but if you work at LinkedIn, contact me and I will send you screenshots.</p>

  <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/blog/use-jekyll-for-massive-blog-traffic/">Use Jekyll To Keep Your Blog From Folding Under Traffic</a></h2>
  <p class="post_subheader">10/4/2012 by Kapil</p>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of blogs fold under traffic, particularly on Hacker News.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure why this happens, but I&#8217;ve seen it happen under not-that-crazy traffic loads. Anecdotally, a HN story at around #10 will have around 100 concurrent visitors staying for 30 seconds each. The server gets maybe three requests per second. I know nothing about server performance, but a setup with a few processes should be able to handle this no problem.</p>

<p>One way to solve this problem is to use a third-party blog service like Posterous or Tumblr. They seem to handle the traffic, at the tradeoff of hosting the blog on <a href='http://ycombinator.posterous.com'>their own their domain</a>. This isn&#8217;t great if for blogs who want the associated SEO benefit of inbound links to their own domain. Also not great for companies or people who want lots of customization (e.g. to get readers into a conversion funnel).</p>

<p>Scaling up processes manually on AWS or Heroku works but is slightly annoying since it is hard to predict when traffic will spike. Programmers better than myself can probably write scripts to do this, but this seems inelegant given blog pages are static assets and should be quick to load anyway.</p>

<p>The best solution I&#8217;ve found to the problem is to use <a href='http://www.jekyllrb.com'>Jekyll</a>, a static site generator, to create static html files.</p>

<p>This solution has held up to a couple hundred concurrent visitors with a single Heroku process with no perceptible decrease in performance [1], and I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m not even doing it right. [2]</p>

<p>This blog&#8217;s code is <a href='https://github.com/kapilkale/personal-site---blog'>hosted publicly on Github</a> and demonstrates the simplicity behind Jekyll&#8217;s implementation.</p>

<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s a basic Sinatra app. [3]</li>

<li>There&#8217;s a _config.yml in the repo citing where posts are written in markdown, and where they&#8217;ll be sent to when compiled.</li>

<li>There&#8217;s a layout for posts.</li>

<li>Typing Jekyll into the command line compiles the posts into HTML files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, this leaves users to configure things like RSS feeds, sharing buttons, tags, styling, etc. But I&#8217;d expect some of the people who are trying to run traffic-heavy company or personal blogs might also want to customize such things.</p>

<p>[1]I&#8217;m hosting on the free Heroku plan for which I have one process only. We used a similar configuration for the <a href='http://www.giftrocket.com'>GiftRocket blog</a> and it held up to over a thousand concurrent visitors.</p>

<p>[2] There should be a way to configure the server to render an index.html file for a given public route automatically (e.g. for a request to /blog/use-jekyll-for-massive-blog-traffic render /blog/use-jekyll-for-massive-blog-traffic/index.html). Right now, I&#8217;m having Sinatra <a href='https://github.com/kapilkale/personal-site---blog/blob/master/home.rb'>read the file</a>, which I suspect takes more time than if it were configured lower down the stack. If you know what I should be doing, would love to hear it.</p>

<p>[3] Unnecessary, but I figured I might actually host some small projects here.</p>

  <h2 class="post_title"><a href="/blog/fizzbuzz/">Fizzbuzz isn't a coding test</a></h2>
  <p class="post_subheader">9/29/2012 by Kapil</p>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p>I was shocked when I first read Jeff Atwood&#8217;s post about <a href='http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html'>programmers who can&#8217;t program</a>. Those who have formally studied computer science should be able to write if-then statements, right?</p>

<p>The reason programmers fail Fizzbuzz is because Fizzbuzz isn&#8217;t a &#8220;coding&#8221; test. It&#8217;s an analytical thinking test. And these &#8220;programmers&#8221; don&#8217;t know how to think analytically.</p>

<p>In fact, it&#8217;s pretty easy to separate the coding part from the analytical thinking part. Ask some smart business analysts with no coding experience to <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhFDbIGnRB-LdE94YmhaLU43T1lCRW1IWmhEV1ZJblE'>solve FizzBuzz in Excel</a>. All should be able to do it.</p>

<p>Those interviewing for entry-level business analyst positions aren&#8217;t expected to be fluent in Excel. Excel is just a tool used to get the job done. They are, however, expected to be able to solve business problems, and are usually tested on that skill with case interviews and such.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t fair to conclude that these entry-level programmers don&#8217;t know how to code. They&#8217;d probably be able to translate pseudocode into a working program [1]. But the real issue is that they don&#8217;t know how to solve problems analytically, which is far more valuable. That&#8217;s the reason Fizzbuzz is an important test.</p>

<p>For some employers, the lesson here might be to stop looking for coders with higher-order thinking, and instead find people who already have the higher-order thinking down and teach them how to code.</p>
